		/**
		* Instructions : Mad Libs!
		* 1. Create a "Mad Libs" web page. It should tell a story, leaving empty <spans>'s with id attributes of 'noun1', 'adjective2', 'verb3', etc. Practice
		*    using the console along with `querySelector` and `textContent` to fill in the missing information one at a time.
		* 2. After doing this manually, put these operations into a script tag, and use variables to store each word to be filled in before placing it into the *    web page, so that the template will be filled out automatically each time the page loads, but the information will be easy to change later.
		* 3. Finally, prompt the visitor repeatedly to provide their own mad libs words. Save their responses as variables and then place those variables into *    the page to make a crazy story for them.
