								<strong>Fit financing to the way your company uses Apple gear.</strong>
								<p>Technology life cycles are different for every company. Apple Financial Services works with businesses to match payment structures to their Technology upgrades.</p>
							</li>
							<li class="list-item">
								<strong>Keep your fleet up to date.</strong>
								<p>Regular technology upgrades through leasing reduce compatibility issues&nbsp;and minimize the costs associated with having multiple generations of&nbsp;equipment.</p>
							</li>
							<li class="list-item">
								<strong>Include Apple and non-Apple gear and&nbsp;services.</strong>
								<p>Apple Financial Services offers financing for more than just your Apple equipment. Get services, accessories, AppleCare, and third-party gear all in one&nbsp;payment.</p>
							</li>
							<li class="list-item">
								<strong>Leasing Apple gear benefits your cash&nbsp;flow.</strong>
								<p>For qualifying businesses, leasing equipment often means paying less over time than an initial cash&nbsp;purchase.</p>
							</li>
							<li class="list-item">
								<strong>Financing means greater&nbsp;flexibility.</strong>
								<p>Leasing through Apple Financial Services means your business can add to the lease at any time during the term and extend the lease term when business needs call for&nbsp;it.</p>
							</li>
							<li class="list-item">
								<strong>Financing also means greater&nbsp;predictability.</strong>
								<p>A clearly specified payment stream means your business knows&nbsp;what its technology costs will be during the financed term. That&nbsp;means fewer surprises for accountants and finance&nbsp;departments.</p>
